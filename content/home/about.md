# About

Robert is a senior research associate in bioinformatics at the Moseley Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Lab, which is part of the Markey Cancer Center at the University of Kentucky. I work with our collaborators to analyse a variety of -omics data, including transcriptomics and metabolomics using both previously established and newly developed methods.

I have 12 years experience analysing -omics level data, and 7 as an R programmer and developer. I authored the
[`categoryCompare`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/categoryCompare.html) Bioconductor package
for comparing -omics data using annotations.

<h2>Manual Linking?</h2>
<p>Using <code>blogdown</code> for generating websites and blog-posts from <code>Rmarkdown</code> files
with lots of inserted code and figures
seems pretty awesome, but sometimes you want to include a figure manually, either
because you want to generate something manually and convert it (say
for going from SVG of lots of points to hi-res PNG), or because it is a figure
from something else (<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Standard_deviation_diagram.svg">like this figure from wikipedia</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="where-to" class="section level2">
<h2>Where to??</h2>
<p>To do this, you want the text of your <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag to your image to be:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src = &quot;/img/image_file.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;</code></pre>
<p>And then put the image itself in the directory <code>/static/img/image_file.png</code></p>
<p><img src = "/img/Standard_deviation_diagram.svg"></img></p>

<p>This information is also mentioned in <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/static-files.html">section 2.7 of the Blogdown book</a>. Obviously I need to
do more reading.</p>
